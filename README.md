Requires [**Discord**](https://discordapp.com/) desktop app with [**BetterDiscord**](https://github.com/BetterDiscord/Installer/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta) installed.

After installing BetterDiscord:
1. Download [**DiscordNight.theme.css**](DiscordNight.theme.css) and navigate to **Settings > Themes** and click on **Open Themes Folder** or place the file in **%appdata%/BetterDiscord/themes**
2. Refresh Discord using **CTRL+R** or restart Discord.
3. Go to **Settings > BetterDiscord > Themes** and enable **DiscordNight**.

- Make sure to have **Dark Theme** enabled in **Settings > Appearance > Theme** and select **Dark**.  

- The theme was made for the default **16px** option for CHAT FONT SCALING and SPACE BETWEEN MESSAGE GROUPS settings but it will work on the other options.

- BetterDiscord **Minimal Mode** is currently not supported.

Keep in mind that things may break at any time because of Discords background updates which may cause you to have to reinstall BetterDiscord or wait for the theme to be updated.  
Incase there is anything that has not yet been fixed or any plugin related issues feel free to either make a [issue](https://github.com/KillYoy/DiscordNight/issues/new) or contact me **KillYoy#0295** on Discord.

This theme supports [**USRBG**](https://github.com/Discord-Custom-Covers/usrbg) by [**Tropical**](https://github.com/Tropix126).

## Installing DiscordNight using other methods (Not recommended)
- If you don't want to use BetterDiscord or it does not work for some reason the CSS can be injected using Discords developer tools using **Ctrl+Shift+I** in the Desktop app or F12 in the browser. In the **Sources** tab go click on **assets** and find the file that ends with **.css** and paste in the code from **DiscordNight.css** into it, if done correctly the theme should be loaded until the next time Discord restarts (Keep in mind that images loaded from an external address will not load this way).

## Installing DiscordNight to your internet browser
- By using a stylesheet addon like Stylus, you can create a style for **discordapp.com** and paste in the code from **DiscordNight.css** (Not everything will work correctly like scrollbars and external images)
